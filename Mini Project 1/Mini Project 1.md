# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database (1970-2017) 💣🌍

This project conducts an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), examining the trends, tactics, and impact of over 180,000 terrorist attacks worldwide between 1970 and 2017.

## ✨ Motivation

This analysis was sparked by a recent, tragic real-world event: a terrorist attack in Pahalgam, India. As reports surfaced, a familiar narrative re-emerged linking the incident to Pakistan. This project was born from a desire to move beyond anecdotal headlines and test this narrative against comprehensive, long-term data.

The goal was to discover the **"ground truth"** by investigating global patterns to see if this reputation is empirically supported and, more broadly, to understand the true landscape of global terrorism by comparing all nations.

## 💾 The Dataset

This project uses the **Global Terrorism Database (GTD)**, an open-source database maintained by researchers at START (University of Maryland).

* **Source:** [Kaggle: Global Terrorism Database (GTD)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/START-UMD/gtd)
* **Content:** Contains systematic data on over 180,000 domestic and international terrorist incidents from 1970 through 2017.
* **Methodology:** The original dataset is overwhelmingly large (130+ columns). To focus the analysis, I strategically curated a smaller dataset, selecting only the columns relevant to the core questions: *who, what, where, when, and how*.

---

## ⚙️ Tech Stack

The entire analysis was performed using Python and the following core data science libraries:
* **Pandas:** For data ingestion, cleaning, and manipulation.
* **NumPy:** For numerical operations.
* **Matplotlib:** For creating static, foundational visualizations.
* **Seaborn:** For more advanced and statistically informative visualizations.

## 🔎 The Analytical Story: Key Findings

This EDA followed a narrative path, letting each discovery guide the next question.

### 1. The "When" 🗓️: Has terrorism always been this way?

**Finding:** No. The data reveals a clear "three-act story."
* **Act 1 (1970s):** The Emerging Threat (slow, gradual increase).
* **Act 2 (1980-2004):** The Volatile Plateau (sharp peaks and valleys, but no sustained growth).
* **Act 3 (2005-2017):** The Great Escalation. A sudden, dramatic surge, climbing relentlessly to its grim apex in **2014**—the most intense year for terrorism in the 47-year record.

### 2. The "How" 💥: What tactics are being used?

**Finding:** One tactic dominates all others: **Bombing/Explosion**.
* This single tactic towers over all other methods (Armed Assault, Assassination, etc.) combined.
* The post-2005 "Great Escalation" is almost *entirely* an escalation of bombings. The trend line for bombings is a "near-perfect mirror" of the overall global attack trend.

### 3. The "Where" 🗺️: Is this a global problem?

**Finding:** No, it's a *concentrated* one. The vast majority of attacks are clustered in a few key nations.
* 🥇 **1. Iraq** (24,636 attacks)
* 🥈 **2. Pakistan** (14,368 attacks)
* 🥉 **3. Afghanistan** (12,731 attacks)
* 🏅 **4. India** (11,960 attacks)

### 4. Deep Dives 🔬: What's happening inside these hotbeds?

<details>

- **Confirmation:** The story of Iraq is the story of the global trend, but amplified.
- **Dominant Tactic:** The tactical landscape is "completely dominated" by **Bombing/Explosion** (over 18,000 incidents).
- **Conclusion:** The 2014 global surge *was* the surge of bombings in Iraq.

<summary><strong>Click to explore the deep dive on India 🇮🇳</strong></summary>

- **When:** India's timeline is a "stark mirror" of the global post-2005 escalation.
- **Where:** The crisis is not nationwide. It is "hyper-concentrated" in **Jammu and Kashmir** (2,454 attacks), which towers over all other states.
- **How:** `Bombing/Explosion` is the most common tactic (4,825 incidents), followed by `Armed Assault` (3,184).

</details>

### 5. The "Impact" 📈: How successful and lethal are these attacks?

This is the most alarming finding.
* **Lethality:** The "Number of Kills per Year" chart perfectly mirrors the attack frequency, peaking in 2014. Iraq leads with 78,589 fatalities.
* **Effectiveness:** An astonishing **89% of all recorded attacks were deemed "successful."**
* **Intent:** Suicide attacks are actually rare (only ~3.6% of incidents). This implies most attacks are planned with the perpetrator's escape in mind.

## 🏁 Conclusion

This exploratory analysis reveals a dramatic shift in the nature and scale of global terrorism.

1.  **Drastic Escalation:** After 2005, attacks escalated dramatically, peaking in 2014. This trend is not uniform but is **highly concentrated in Iraq, Afghanistan, Pakistan, and India**, and directly correlates with the rise of ISIL.
2.  **Dominant Tactic:** The primary method is **Bombing/Explosion**, suggesting a strategy focused on guerrilla warfare and mass casualties.
3.  **Alarming Success Rate:** Most alarmingly, **89% of recorded attacks were "successful,"** indicating that preventative security measures are frequently bypassed.

**Implication:** The data shows that modern terrorism, particularly in the 2007-2017 decade, was less about small, clandestine cells and more about large-scale, quasi-conventional warfare in a few key hotspots.
